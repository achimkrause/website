I am a Førsteamanuensis (Associate Professor) at University of Oslo, in the Algebra, Topology and Geometry section.

Previously, I did my PhD in Bonn with [Peter Teichner](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/teichner/Math/), and a postdoc in Münster with [Thomas Nikolaus](https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVV5WS/WebHop/user/nikolaus/index.html). During those times, I also got to spend some time in Berkeley, Heidelberg and at the [IAS](https://ias.edu).

In my research, I am interested in a wide array of things from stable homotopy theory, including algebraic K-theory, THH and TC and equivariant homotopy theory.

title: About Me
---

Since August 2024, I am a Førsteamanuensis (Associate Professor) at University of Oslo. Previously, I was:

* 2011-2013: Master student at Tübingen University, supervisor [Frank Loose](https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/en/research-chairs/maphy/people-1/frankloose/frankloose))
* 2013-2018: PhD student at MPIM Bonn, supervisor [Peter Teichner](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/teichner/Math/)
* 2018-2024: Akademischer Rat auf Zeit (comparable to non tenure-track Assistant Professor) at Münster University, in the work group of [Thomas Nikolaus](https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVV5WS/WebHop/user/nikolaus/index.html)

During those times, I also got to experience some shorter stays at other places:

* Springs 2014 and 2017: at UC Berkeley
* Spring 2022: at Institut Mittag-Leffler for the program [Higher Algebraic Structures in Algebra, Topology and Geometry](https://www.mittag-leffler.se/activities/higher-algebraic-structures-in-algebra-topology-and-geometry/)
* Summer 2023: at Heidelberg University as substitute professor for [Otmar Venjakob](https://www.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/~venjakob/)
* Spring 2024: at the IAS as member of the [special year on p-adic Arithmetic Geometry](https://www.ias.edu/math/events/sp-p-adic-arithmetic-geometry)

# Interests

I am broadly interested in the interplay between algebra and homotopy theory, including topics such as Algebraic K-theory and THH, higher category theory and Higher Algebra, and equivariant and motivic homotopy theory.

Usually, I am more on the homotopy-theoretic side, such as in [my paper on Picard groups in equivariant homotopy theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05551), [my paper with Thomas Nikolaus on relative THH](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03477), or [my paper with Nikolaus and McCandless on polygonic spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07686). 

Sometimes I also end up on the purely algebraic side, but always with a homotopy-theoretic view, such as in [my paper with Antieau and Nikolaus on computing K-theory of $Z/p^n$](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.04329), my [thesis on periodicity in the Adams-Novikov $E_2$ page and motivic homotopy theory](/files/thesis_krause.pdf) or work in progress with [Jesper Grodal](https://web.math.ku.dk/~jg/) on Picard groups of stable module categories with integer coefficients.

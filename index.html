<p>I am a Førsteamanuensis (Associate Professor) at University of Oslo, in the Algebra, Topology and Geometry section.</p>

<p>Previously, I did my PhD in Bonn with <a href="https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/teichner/Math/">Peter Teichner</a>, and a postdoc in Münster with <a href="https://www.uni-muenster.de/IVV5WS/WebHop/user/nikolaus/index.html">Thomas Nikolaus</a>. During those times, I also got to spend some time in Berkeley, Heidelberg and at the <a href="https://ias.edu">IAS</a>.</p>

<p>In my research, I am interested in a wide array of things from stable homotopy theory, including algebraic K-theory, THH and TC and equivariant homotopy theory.</p>
